Thanks to [MBoffin](https://twitter.com/MBoffin), I finally took the leap and tried [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

His [pdf zine](https://mboffin.itch.io/gamedev-with-pico-8-issue1) warmed up the learning curve quite a bit, but I've only just worked through the first tutorial.

Onward always.
