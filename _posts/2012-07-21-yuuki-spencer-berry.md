<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/375272713">Yuuki Spencer Berry</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/spencerberry">Spencer Berry</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

I shot and edited the Yuuki portion of what was going to be a quick diptych designed to depict a few tricks quickly and accurately.  My half, as is often the case, never was.

I traded this footage to Save Deth for one of the original Envys, but Dave felt it had to be spiced up with some editing so hopefully he won't mind me posting this.  This cut is from March of 2007.
