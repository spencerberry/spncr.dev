I like card games, especially trump (bridge, spades, hearts) and rummy (500, gin, ascending) types.

I like that they take skill but also can be easily taught and have shared rules but variations that add ample variety and depth.

As I decided I needed to finally learn to develop games, one of my first attempts is a text based gin rummy game.

I chose it because it has simple rules that I thought would be easy to implement, and I could sort of imagine how it would work.

I spent most of January getting it working and it does, now, work. I hope I can get an online version using Flask soon.
