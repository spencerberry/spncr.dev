It looks like I might've, but I am still pondering, drawing, and studying.

I decided the necro game - while still a goal - is pretty far beyond my current abilities.

The need to have pathfinding, AI, targeting and a few libraries to help out complicated things. Bugs were piling up faster than features.

I've been thinking of a simpler way to keep progressing, so for now I am working through [these tutorials](https://github.com/SSYGEA/blog/issues/11) (thank you, [SSYGEA](https://github.com/SSYGEA)) and making a basic block falling game, with some modifications to [this project](https://simplegametutorials.github.io/blocks/)Â (thanks whomever wrote [simple game tutorials](https://github.com/simplegametutorials/simplegametutorials)).

So far I have the blocks and some colors and a grid.
