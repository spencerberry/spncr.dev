I received prototypes from Hspin a day after the contest started.

They were TINY. Â It is one thing to guess and check from different yoyos but the combination of 50mm diameter and slimline made it truly seem like a miniature.

The weight distribution made them feel like solid rocks but spin times were less than adequate.

Without a fully thought out response system, they burned through duncan pads in ~10 mins and peeled almost all other pads right off in a matter of throws.

Frank from Difeyo gave me some great, basic advice on weight distribution (which you can see reflected in the future).

Kyle weems also cut a few of them for me in order to get the gap a bit smaller (go go mod workshop).

Mostly, I hid them from the public in shame.
