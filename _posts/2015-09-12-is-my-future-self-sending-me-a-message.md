I stumbled upon this via [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), while procrastinating writing:

[Robert Hanks: On Putting Things Off](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n17/robert-hanks/on-putting-things-off)

It gave me a strange feeling, like one of those moments where destiny could shift, or keep chugging along. Â Where I could see through the kaleidoscope, through one set of reflections, something that I could become, or fight against, but will only be fueled by passivity. I want to twist the beads and see a different destiny, but there is something to be learned, something to be feared, about letting things settle.

And then somehow Winter Wonderland came onto my Spotify channel and I remembered it is Friday.
