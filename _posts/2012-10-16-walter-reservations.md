With the recent photos, I've been receiving a lot of Walter reservations. Â To be clear:

- Reservation do not cost any money
- The first batch will be numbered 00-49
- I won't charge anyone until I have the numbered Walter in hand and ready to ship
- Walter will be $120 shipped in the US, $10 additional for international shipping (but not a problem - I love everyone!)
- I'd love to give discounts to those in special circumstances, but I've chosen to sell to everyone at the same price so that I can pay off the production costs and put some money in the bank to run the 2nd batch and make a sequel.
- Thanks to [chris](http://cariboublog.com "CLYW"), [david](http://www.onedropyoyos.com/index.php), and [sonny](http://anti-yo.com) for all the help
- [Email me](mailto:spencerwberry@gmail.com) to be put on the list

Here are the remaining serials from the first batch (most of the 2nd batch, 50-99 are still available):

(current serial list has moved to [this post](http://spencerberry.com/?p=576 "Walter 2013"))
