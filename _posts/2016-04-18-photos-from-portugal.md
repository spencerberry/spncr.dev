For [work](http://automattic.com), I travelled to Portugal from the 11th to 18th of April.

I have always been bad about taking pictures on trips like this, mostly because I don't want to miss the present moment fiddling with my phone.

When a view moves me, I want to be present with it. I want to let the light dance over my own retinas and to enjoy the bubbling feeling the moment creates inside of me.

Then I get home and I wish I had more photos.

For this trip, I tried to find a balance between the two.
