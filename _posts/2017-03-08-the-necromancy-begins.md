My big (huge) first project is about a corpse that is instructed to build an undead army from those living in proximity.

It is way bigger than I can even start to implement.

So for now I am working on a NES zelda clone where your main "verb" is capturing the souls of others.

I am learning to make pixel art as I go along, so that's why my art is lame:

Added some trees and grass in godot:

Pixel art sure is a time suck. Thought I'd quickly "redo" the grass and trees and ended up losing a few days to pixels...still unhappy:
