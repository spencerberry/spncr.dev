[Gelato Bandelore](http://vimeo.com/46157163) from [Spencer Berry](http://vimeo.com/user705897) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

I shot and edited this in the Summer of 2008 with Sonny from [Anti-yo](http://anti-yo.com "Anti-yo").  DVX-100A, Final Cut.  I never released it because I wanted to add some finishing touches - 4 years later - here it is, still unfinished.  Set it free!

Sonny says:

> A video that Spencer Berry and I made in late summer 2008. Never got around to finishing it, so this is a rough cut. Filmed at La Copa Loca in San Francisco’s mission district. Yo-yos used are Anti-Yo Eetzilla and an early Ywet prototype. Song is “Bros” by Panda Bear.
