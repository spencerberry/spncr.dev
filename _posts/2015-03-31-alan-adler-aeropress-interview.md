I just came across this interview.  I hadn't realize before this that that the AeroPress and the Aerobie are the same inventor.

I hope that when I am in my 70s I will have a similar variety of inventions.  I better get cracking!

I think a lot about ideas and projects and I don't spend enough time finishing things.  It's time to change that.

Here is the article:  [The Invention of the Perfect Cup of Coffee](https://medium.com/backchannel/first-alan-adler-invented-the-aerobie-now-he-s-created-the-perfect-cup-of-coffee-c5e94ccc538e "The Invention of the Perfect Cup of Coffee")
