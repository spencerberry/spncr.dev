## I have always been a builder

I am a human, always changing and learning

I create, even if the result is only a mess

I've designed my own retro modern yoyos, managed a range of software projects, and directed my own films

I am learning, striving to understand, and to create things meaning

I appreciate when something is thought through to the point of simplicity
