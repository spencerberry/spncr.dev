<h3>
I have always been a builder.
</h3>
I was a LEGO kid, with an ever evolving interest in creation.

I've designed my own retro modern yoyos, managed a range of software projects, and directed my own films (yes, shot on film).

I am always eager to learn, to understand, and to create things.

I appreciate when something is so well thought through that it appears simple and basic.
