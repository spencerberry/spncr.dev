<h3>
I have always been a builder.
</h3>
<p>I was a LEGO kid, with an ever evolving interest in creation.</p>

<p>I've designed my own retro modern yoyos, managed a range of software projects, and directed my own films.</p>

<p>I am always eager to learn, to understand, and to create thing of meaning.</p>

<p>I appreciate when something is thought through to the point of simplicity.</p>
