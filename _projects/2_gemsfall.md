victories:
  - Refining logic into tables to avoid duplicate code and simplify future features (cells, the block, the board)
  - Writing animations that run smoothly, in code that loops 60 times a second
  - Finding that addictive, satisfying feel and complementing it with sound and mechanics
todos:
  - Refactor the background grid so that effects can be passed through it
  - Deeper audio and more layers
  - Some trails for fast drops that add more punch to the feel

I have some ideas for a multiplayer version of this game, but wanted to start out with a very simple prototype to test the feel and rules.

PICO-8 is a lovely way to learn game development, as the constraints guide the design decisions.

Try the combo system! Let the sound guide you, it isn't all speed, but pacing.

[PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php "PICO-8 Fantasy Console") is a virtual console.
