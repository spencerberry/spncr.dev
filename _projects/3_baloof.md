This was my first complete pico-8 game, a sort of flappy bird infinite runner.

I've always loved parallax and thought it was a perfect fit for an otherwise simplistic design.

Try to fly as high as you can while dodging the ravens.

[PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php "PICO-8 Fantasy Console") is a virtual console.
