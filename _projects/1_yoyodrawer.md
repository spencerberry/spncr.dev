The goal for this project was to work on a simple project without the guidance of a tutorial.

The yoyo drawer takes uploaded yoyos and displays them as a collection with a bit of data about each.

I've been asked many times how many yoyos I own, and if I continue to catalog mine here, one day I might know the answer.
