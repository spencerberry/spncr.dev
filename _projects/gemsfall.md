challenges:
  - Dividing logic into modules to avoid duplicate code and simplify future features
  - Writing animations that run smoothly, in code that loops 60 times a second
  - Finding that addictive, satisfying feel
todos:
  - Refactor the background to prepare it for some more effects
  - Deeper audio and more layers
  - Some trails for fast drops that make it ethereal
