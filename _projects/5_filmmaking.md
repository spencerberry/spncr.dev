challenges:
  - Learning to delegate, especially for bigger products (Snout, Fisherman)
  - Constraints are extra important, for me, when it comes to making art! (Yoyo stuff)
todos:
  - Keep posting periodically to instagram
  - Shoot tutorials for some of my tricks
  - Add the rest of my film school projects, and video contest stuff

I have a Bachelor's Degree in motion picture and television directing.

I've also spent some time shooting and editing yoyo clip videos for friends of mine, from 2000 onward.
