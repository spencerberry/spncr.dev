challenges:
  - Adjusting from rails to the much simpler Jekyll
  - Themes can modify tons of things! Ended up having to rollback a theme after realizing it broke github pages.
todos:
  - Make more projects!
  - Would be cool to get tools working like tags with their own list of projects and links to the tech info

I needed somewhere to display my projects so far, and wanted something simple.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) kept me in the Ruby mindset and was quick to get working.
