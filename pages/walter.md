## Walter is sold out - thanks for all the support

[Related posts](http://spencerberry.com/tag/walter)

\[gallery columns="2" ids="688,687,686,685"\] Walter is a modern retro slimline throw toy.

There will be 100 Walters sold, numbered 00-99.

## Thanks to those who made Walter possible

Chris from [CLYW](http://cariboublog.com) helped with the CAD work, finance and orchestration of the project.

[One drop](http://www.onedropyoyos.com/) did the machining.

Sonny from [Anti-yo](http://anti-yo.com) had them blasted and hard coated.

## The Build

![walter in hand]({{site.url}}/assets/img/photo-1.jpg)

Walter is 54mm in diameter and just under 32mm wide.  The gap is about 3.2mm because it is a large bearing, but recessed into the walls a bit.  Walter has a mass of 64.2 grams.

All numbered Walters are matte black.  Due to the nature of the process, some also have a bit of a splash/spray in shades of black.  The hardcoat marks very easily and can be colored on with colored pencil (erases), crayon (doesn't come off easily), or chalk (barely).  The hardcoat means it can take a lot more abuse - but it can be scuffed a lot easier.

Walter will come in a custom made wood box.

They will each be sanded (to prevent the rough texture of the blasting from breaking string), oiled (10-ball shieldless bearings with 3in1), and assembled.

They come with either flowable silicone or CLYW snow tires (the turquoise ones, aka "all season") for response. This will need to be replaced eventually if you are a ripper. Be a ripper!

Walter will ship with Kitty String FAT, most likely in Gold.

## Warnings & dissuasions

### This is not an unresponsive yoyo!

Walter comes back with a tug.  Many of my testers attempted to find an unresponsive configuration (dry bearing will certainly do it).  But they were very disappointed with the consistency of play!  This is because this yoyo has high walls and a recessed bearing (the gap is ~3.5mm).  If you tune him unresponsive you will have a catchy yoyo that doesn't come back with a tug and a bad time.

### This is not a competition optimized yoyo.

Walter can do most yoyo tricks from shoot the moon to a laceration.  But he isn't going to give you 60 second combos and he isn't going to help you win any freestyle competitions.  I consider Walter to be a cross between a fixed axle and a bearing (even though he is completely ball bearing).  He plays uber smooth on the string, comes back with a fly away, can do stall tricks, regens, frog in a bag, etc.  He takes a bit from modern and pays homage to the retro.  Please don't order a Walter if you are expecting a modern string trick yoyo that will spin for days and forgive mistakes.  He will punish string trick errors and bruise you.

### Walter is not a paperweight or a shelf warmer.

I have not intended to make a museum bound collectible.  These yoyos are tested by hand and probably have oil, fingerprints, my body odor, etc.  I would prefer it if you played with him and dinged him up and enjoyed the chaotic styles of yoyoing Walter makes possible.  Of course, if you buy a Walter you can do what you want with him, but I highly encourage you to ponder my intentions.  I've made a small run of these for myself and my friends to have a modern slimline responsive throw.  This is a unique player in an age of a flooded, unresponsive yoyo market.  Join me in celebrating - let's fly away.

### Walter is not for everyone .

It won't hurt my feelings if you don't buy a Walter - but it will bum me out if he sits unplayed because you don't like tug responsive throws, bruised knuckles, or improv beast mode.

## Maintenance

That said, if Walter starts to get unresponsive, oil the bearing.  Brain lube work ([this is the same stuff](http://www.amazon.com/Super-Lube-Syncolon-PTFE-viscosity/dp/B000BXOGHY/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1366490835&sr=8-4&keywords=superlube)), especially if you like a quiet yoyo.  I oiled them with [3in1](http://www.amazon.com/3-IN-ONE-10135-Multi-Purpose-Oil-oz/dp/B0083V8LPO/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1366490879&sr=1-1&keywords=3+in1+oil) when I put them together.  It smells awesome, but  the bearing is louder than if you lubed it with the ptfe stuff.

If you do get one that cuts strings (and it cuts them thread by thread - watch your first few closely), either sand with 600 grit sandpaper or rub a leather belt/wallet on it.  I highly doubt that will be the case because I have diligently sanded every single half and personally tested it.

## Logistics

Walter will cost $120 shipped in the US.  I will gladly ship Walter to any country, but will charge you for part of the shipping cost.

Once I have the final weight (with package), I will be able to make international estimates.

I live in Omaha, NE, USA and attend contests in MN, KS, IA, etc.  If you want to coordinate with me I am glad to sell in person.

Walter will be the same price in person.  All serial numbered Walters will sell for $120.
