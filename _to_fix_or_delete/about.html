<h2> I have always been a builder. </h2>
<p>I am a human, always changing and learning.</p>

<p>I've always been driven to create, even if the result is only a mess.</p>

<p>I've designed my own retro modern yoyos, managed a range of software projects, and directed my own films.</p>

<p>I am always eager to learn, to understand, and to create things of meaning.</p>

<p>I have self-studied development in my spare time, building games and web apps step by step, learning deeply as I go.</p>

<p>I appreciate when something is thought through to the point of simplicity.</p>
