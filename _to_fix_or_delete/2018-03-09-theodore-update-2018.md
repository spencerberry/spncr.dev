I've been getting a lot of questions about Theodore and had to make some big decisions lately, so let me outline them here.

This is a personal project and I am honored to see the level of interest that I have received. I have a full reservation list, and receive regular pings from people asking when I think Theodore will be released.

There are 116 being finished right now in Black.

Once they come back from the finisher, I will assemble and test the first 100.

Then I will engrave their serials.

105 of these are already reserved, which leaves up to 11 left for my wait list!

The wait list has 18 people right, so up to 7 will not receive even be offered one, unless some reservations bail out (which did happen last time).

I decided to fall just short of demand, mainly because I wanted to leave enough raw Theos to prototype and run a few metal editions when I am ready.

Hopefully some people on the reservation list will decide that $150 is too pricey for a basic, responsive, black aluminum yoyo. I'd love for everyone on the wait list to have a chance to buy one, but I cannot guarantee it.

**I have no release date and I will never promise one.**

This project is a personal one, not a business venture and not a brand I am starting up.

I made Walter, and now Theodore because it is a yoyo I want to play with.

To pay for that process, I sell small batches. I am extremely lucky to have enough people interested in this project that I don't have to run marketing or try and promote it just to make ends meet.

Thank you for all your support!

One last thing to think about, **if you are on the reservation list.**

The finish I chose is a bit rough. It will cut strings.

I sanded mine lightly a few times to get it to stop. I decided this finish is worth the extra labor, since it has a nicer texture and feel than the other options I have explored.

When Theo is ready to ship, I am going to offer them first to folks who want to take the risk themselves. That means, if you want to sand your own Theo, I am willing to ship them out sooner since I will not have to manually sand and test it.

If you'd prefer me to sand it, I am glad to do it (and agree as part of my own quality control, I should be the one to do it), but it will take me longer to send out.

Let's hope the last few stages run smoothly and I can ship these out soon!
