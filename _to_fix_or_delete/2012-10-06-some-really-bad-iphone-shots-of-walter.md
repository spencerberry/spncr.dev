I will get some more pictures when I get a finished one - but here is the first RAW prototype from the manufacturer.  Thanks to [Chris of CLYW](http://cariboublog.com) for engineering and financing the project.  Thanks to [David from one drop](http://www.onedropyoyos.com/index.php) for manufacturing Walter.  And soon to thank [Sonny from Anti-yo](http://anti-yo.com) for finishing.  Walter will have a matte-black hardcoat.
