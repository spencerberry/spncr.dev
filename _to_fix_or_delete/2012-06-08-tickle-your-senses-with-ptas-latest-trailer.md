There are a few films that have changed my life upon viewing...leaving trails of humanity dashing about my organs. [Magnolia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175880/) and [There Will Be Blood](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469494/) are two such films.

I have high hopes for this latest work, which I have been watching keenly from the sidelines.  A buddy of mine, Evan Jones, had the privilege of working on The Master as either an electrician or a grip, but only for a few days while they were shooting in the Bay Area.  Even from the stories he has told me it sounds like it will be another chilling experience.
