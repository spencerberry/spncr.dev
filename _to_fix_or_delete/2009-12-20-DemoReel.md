[Spencer Berry Demo Reel](http://vimeo.com/9140971) from [Spencer Berry](http://vimeo.com/user705897) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

This is the demo reel I graduated from University with.  Most of the footages comes from two projects: The Snout and The Fisherman.  Both of these films are incomplete and I will continue to update the site with their progress.  See the Project bar to hone in on information for either film.  As of this reel they are missing soundscapes, color timing, and fine grain editing.

The Snout will likely have another, third and final scene added to it, making it a triptych.
