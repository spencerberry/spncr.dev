Today I received this photo from sonny of [anti-yo](http://anti-yo.com).  He just picked up the prototype batch of Walters from the finishing shop.  They were wet-blasted to get the slip-matte feel and then coated with a Type III hardcoat in black.  I cannot wait to get one in my hands.

The first batch should be available early 2013.  Walter will cost $120 and only be sold directly to the buyer.

There will be 100 sold, serial 00 through 99.  If you want to reserve a serial number, [let me know](mailto:spencerwberry@gmail.com) - I won't ask for money until I have the final product in hand.
