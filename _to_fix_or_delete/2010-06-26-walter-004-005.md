Mid-2010 was the first time that I saw a CAD drawing that I was okay with aesthetically. I had arrived at a yoyo, finally, that reflected the simplicity of aesthetic and general shape I was going for.

Walter was still imagined at this stage at a 50mm diameter and ~26mm width. Tiny!

I was also quite obsessed with parabolas.  Pretty, but is it functional?

The superimposition is a render of the yoyos face.  He was quite portly at this stage : 68 grams.

If you are curious about Walter One-Three, so am I.
