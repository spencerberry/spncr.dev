Yoyo lovers and yoyo learning to lovers, Walter has about 10 serial numbers awaiting reservation and probably 25 people who have reserved without payment. The rest are spinning right now.

I am going to be in Finland from July 4th-16th - I will have intermittent email communication - but I will not be shipping any Walters. If you want yours before then, act now. Otherwise, wish me luck. I will be judging the [Finnish National Yoyo Contest](https://www.facebook.com/events/148707621961314/) while I am out there.
