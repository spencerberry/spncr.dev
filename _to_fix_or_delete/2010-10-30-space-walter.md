_(Commentary from July 2012) This was just a 'modern' idea I explored once I had the Hspin prototypes in hand. Â Hspin (Chris and Hadrien) were definitely most enthusiastic about this model._

_I was thinking of running it at one point but [Seth](http://savedeth.com "Save Deth") [Peterson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_fh1IyuL6o "Seth Peterson is on Youtube"), like a good friend, reminded me I wasn't doing a modern yoyo._

_I was trying to move weight outward and I'm not sure this accomplishes that._
